The code for the visualization of data on the status of NYCT subway stations, originally visualized by the [Citizens Budget Commission](http://cbcny.org/) in their [Sisphyus Subway map](http://interactive.cbcny.org/nyct-station-conditions) using [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/). This visualization uses [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com), Leaflet.js, D3.js, and jQuery to visualize the data in a more interactive way. The [visualization is live here](http://bit.ly/1JPxHsk). You can read the [blogpost on the application here](http://wp.me/p2PLpM-1QD).
